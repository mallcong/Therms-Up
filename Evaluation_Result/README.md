# Heat-sealing Endurance to Pressure

To evaluate the endurance of heat-sealed bonding of different plastic bags to air pressure, we tested different inflatable air pouches made of our focused thermoplastic packages (PP, LDPE, HDPE) and its composites. 
We prepared 9 different air pouches with 5 samples for each to have 60 x 60 mm square dimension and made the four edges heat sealed by 3D printer’s extruder nozzle (0.4 mm diameter). 
5 samples for each material were heat-sealed on 5 different locations of printing bed (bottom right and left corner, top right and left corner, and the center) to average out any defected heat-sealing due to the uneven printing bed level. 
We ran the 3D printer to travel following a square-shape path for twice having a 1 mm offset. To measure the yield air pressure, we used a barometric pressure sensor (MPRLS Ported Pressure Sensor, Adafruit) tethered to another air channel branched from a tube connecting between a syringe (150 ml)
and the testing sample. We forced the air to pump in the sample until we find any leakage of air or explosion sound and obtained the maximum pressure value. 
The result is summarized in the Table below.
Each inflatable material result were averaged by 5. 
The retort food package’s heat-sealing has the highest strength and the air leakage happened on the hot-glued air channel tubing area.
