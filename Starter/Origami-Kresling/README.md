This can be done either by manually or getting a little help from a 3D printer to create a folding pattern
(Ref: what is mountain and valley fold? http://www.origami-instructions.com/origami-valley-and-mountain-folds.html) 

1. If you are doing manually, printout the Kresling.pdf file uploaded in this folder in any scale you want (bigger easier)
2. Place the printed pattern on a piece of plastic bag (one layer) and have a ruler and a ball-point pen with you
3. First, we will transfer a mountain fold path of the pattern on the plastic bag. The bold straight line of the print-out indicates the mountain fold.
  so, put a ruller on top of the paper, and follow all the mountain fold line path with the pen so that you can make a emobossed line transferred to the plastic bag underneath.
